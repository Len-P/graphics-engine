# Graphics Engine

This project is a C++ graphics engine developed for a Computer Graphics course. It provides various features for rendering 2D and 3D scenes, including transformations, geometric primitives, lighting models, shading, and more. Below is an overview of the features and functionalities included in this engine:

## Grade

  - Projection transformation

- **Platonic Solids**
  - Cone and cylinder
  - Sphere
  - Torus

- **3D L-Systems**

- **Z-Buffering (Lines)**
  - Z-buffering for line rendering

- **Object Triangulation**
  - Triangulation of objects (converting polygons to triangles)
  - Z-buffering for triangles

- **3D Fractals**
  - BuckyBall fractal
  - Menger sponge fractal

- **Lighting**
  - Ambient lighting
