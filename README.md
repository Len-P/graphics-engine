# Graphics Engine

This project is a C++ graphics engine developed for the Computer Graphics course at the university of Antwerp. **(Grade: 19/20)** It provides various features for rendering 2D and 3D scenes, including transformations, geometry, lighting models, shading, and more. Below is an overview of the features and functionalities included in this engine:

## Features

- **2D Lindenmayer Systems**
  - Supports L-Systems with brackets.

- **Transformations**
  - Basic transformations (translation, rotation)
  - Eye-point transformation
  - Projection transformation

- **3D Objects (wireframes and solids)**
  - Platonic Solids
  - Cone
  - Cylinder
  - Sphere
  - Torus

- **3D Lindenmayer Systems**

- **Z-Buffering**
  - Z-buffered wireframes
  - Z-buffered triangles

- **Object Triangulation (converting polygons to triangles)**

- **3D Fractals**
  - BuckyBall fractal
  - Menger sponge fractal

- **3D Wireframes from Cylinders and Spheres**

- **Lighting**
  - Ambient lighting
  - Diffuse lighting (infinite)
  - Diffuse lighting (point source)
  - Specular lighting

- **Shading**
 
## Usage

The ini directory contains ini files that will be used by the engine to generate .bmp images.
